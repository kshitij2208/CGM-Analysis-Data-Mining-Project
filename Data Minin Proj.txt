Data mining Project
Types of Features(Don't take Mean and STD)(Take features other than these)
1) Zero crossing
2) FFT(Top 8)
3) CGM Velocity
4) Windowed Mean(1-10,5-15,15-25,....)
5) Maximum excursion(Find Max, max insulin bolus)

Prerequisites before feature extraction:
Creating Polynomial fit
Create Feature Vector

Show Scatterplot for argument of a feature
Normalize the features
PCA
function in python PCA
get eigen vector and multiply top 5 eigen Vector to feature matrix, to get updated feature matrix
show
Argue for updated Features
